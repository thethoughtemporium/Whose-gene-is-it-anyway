These are all the plasmids we currently carry in our store at thethoughtemporium.ca

We also covered many of them in our new videos on genetic engineering which can be found here: https://youtu.be/10OUPyamn1w

These plasmids are released as open source, attribution, share alike. If you use them, please give us credit, and if you make something with them, release it under the same license.

Enjoy!
